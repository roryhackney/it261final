# it261final

This repository hosts all the files for my final PHP project in IT261 at Seattle Central Community College.
It uses PHP to dynamically return appropriate content (based on date, database content, etc).

Although it does require registration and login, that is only to demonstrate PHP forms and mySQL databases/tables. Feel free to put in nonsense information to get into the content within. I will not be using the information in any way.
The contact form does actually send the information to my email, so no spam please!

Content:
Registration - PHP form processing and database used
Login - PHP form processing and database used
Home - random images function
About - holds screenshots of database tables
Daily - date and switches used
Portfolio - database and switches used
Portfolio-View - database used
Contact - PHP form processing used

All art is my own - if you want to contact me about my art, please do! The contact form works, or you can message me here or on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roryhackney/">LinkedIn</a>. You can also see more of my work on <a href="rorystories.com">my portfolio</a>.
